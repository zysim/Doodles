          <h1>Intersection Observer Test</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>TL;DR Don't use this for high-perf applications.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Testing out the Intersection Observer API. It works pretty well,
            with a few caveats, especially when scrolling fast:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Don't necessarily trust <code>isIntersecting</code> when using
              <code>threshold</code>
            </li>
            <li>Don't expect it to call the instant it hits a threshold</li>
          </ol>
          <p>These two points are explained below.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="elaboration">
          <h3>Don't Trust <code>isIntersecting</code></h3>
          <p>
            First off,
            <code>IntersectionObserverEntry.isIntersecting === false</code>
            does <em>not</em> mean that it isn't intersecting at a threshold. It
            simply means that the target element isn't intersecting with its
            target at all. In theory. In practice,
            <code>IntersectionObserverEntry.isIntersecting</code> can show
            <code>false</code>, even when you can still see bits of the target.
            More importantly is my first point. Just don't depend on it.
          </p>

          <h3>Don't Expect Observer to Call At Threshold</h3>
          <p>
            The <code>IntersectionObserver</code> isn't designed to be a
            high-perf thing. Its design philosophy is stated in the MDN docs,
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API"
              >a few paragprahs in at the start of the article</a
            >:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            One thing the Intersection Observer API can't tell you: the exact
            number of pixels that overlap or specifically which ones they are...
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            And here too, at the start of
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API#thresholds"
              >thresholds</a
            >:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Rather than reporting every infinitesimal change in how much a
            target element is visible, the Intersection Observer API uses
            thresholds.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Specifically, even when you pass the threshold, especially when
            you're scrolling quickly, it doesn't ping you instantly. It does so
            the next time it's got breathing room to do so. So don't use this
            API to do high-perf stuff.
