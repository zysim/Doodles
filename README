# Doodles
Just a bunch of random web doodles. It's all really basic and of not much use to anyone, especially if you're already experienced with web dev. The only purpose of this folder is for two things:
- To learn new (for me) things, and remember em;
- Keep a record of such things

So yeah that's it.
